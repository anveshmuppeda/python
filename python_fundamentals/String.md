# String 
- When we use "+" operation it is used to add two words.  
```console
$ print("Hello"+" "+"Python!")
"Hello Python!"
```
- When we use "*" operation it is used to multiply  
```console
$ print("Hello" *2)
"Hello Hello"
```
- With the "str" function we can type_cast a number into a string
```console
cost_of_apple = 2
amount_of _apple =input("How many apple do you want?\n")
total_sum = cost_of_apple * int(amount_of_apple) 
print("You have to pay: "+str(total_sum))
$ output
How many apple do you want? 
2
You have to pay: 4

```
