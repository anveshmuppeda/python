# Bitwise Operators  
Bitwise operators **"&","|","^","~"** allow us manipulate single bits of data and return 0 (or) 1 based on the value of the bits that are used  
- & (Conjunction)  
IF 9they are two 1 in both binary numbers than it gives 1  
```console
15 -> 00001111  
22 -> 00010110
output -> 00000110
```
- | (Disjunction)
if they are two 1 and one 0 and one 1 in both binary nymbers than it gives 1 
 ```console
 15 -> 00001111  
 22 -> 00010110  
 output -> 00011111 
```  
- ^(Exclusive)
if they are one 1 and one 0 in both binary numbers than it gives 1 
```console
15 -> 00001111 
22 -> 00010110 
output -> 00011001
```
- ~(Negation)   
if they is one it give zero  
if they is zero it give one  
```console 
22 -> 00010110
output -> 11101001
```
