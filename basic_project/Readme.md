# Python Basic Tasks & Solutions  

## 1. Python Simple Calculator     
Build a basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input, then performs the chosen operation.     
These is used to calculate a simple mathematical calculations like addition,subtraction,nultiplication and division.    
Their is an example that if we wanted to calculate addition then we have to enter choice as 1 and then we have to give numbers like 23 and 45 then we get the result as 68.

## 2. Python Guess The Number  

Generate a random number and ask the user to guess it. Give hints if the guess is too high or too lt  
 This is a game that based on numbers.In this a number is given randomly between the range 0-50.     
 we have to guess the random number.      
 we have five chances of guessing the correct random number.so, if we guess the random number might be  greater than or lower than the random value.if we guess lower number then it shows "your guess number is lower",and if we guess a number that greater than the random number then it shows "your guess number is higher".    
 If our five guesses are incorrect then it shows us as"sorry you have entered a wrong guess",and it shows the random number as the result.

 ## 3. Integer Errors  
Create a program that asks the user for an integer input and handles invalid inputs.   
This program tells about  not to enter a non-numeric characters **(eg"ajay")**     
And also notfloating values like **12.34,34.45**       
We have to enter a valid integer value for it (or) it will show an error in the output      
if we enter an vaild value for it it will show you have entered an integer **("eg, You entered : 1244")**

## 4. Word Finding   
Ask the user for a paragraph of text and count the words, sentences, and occurrences of a particular word    
 First the user ask to enetr a paragraph and then it will ask what the word to search for after entering the word it will count the number of words that are present in the paragraph and will also show how many sentence are present in the paragraph and at last it will show that for what word we search for and how many times it repeats in the paragraph it will displayed.

## 5. Decimal to Binary   
Write a program that converts a decimal number to binary using bitwise operations.   

This is used to convert a decimal number to a binary number      
By entering the decimal number and running the program it will give an output of the binary number.   


## 6.Student Grade
Create a system that calculates and stores student grades. It asks for student names and scores, calculates their grades, and stores them in a list.   

These is uesd to stores student grades.     
In this there will be student memu and in that there will be option for what you what?    
1) Add Student     
In this we will add student  and in that first it ask to enter student name and next enter student score (0-100): and then after it will show the grade of the student name that you have entered.    
2) Display Student  
It will display the student name , student score and grade. It will display what you have add in the first option .   
3) Quit   
It will exit from the program and tell thank you .
